# Opus-mt-en-hi

This model is trained on OPUS dataset. This open parallel is the collection of translated texts from the web. It also includes translations of Wikipedia, WikiSource, WikiBooks, WikiNews and WikiQuote web pages. This GitHub page will provide the link to download the source and the target texts obtained from wiki web pages. And the required pre-processing step also includes tokenizing text using the SentencePiece library. I wonâ€™t go into any further details about their architecture and all.
